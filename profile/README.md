## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
We are SpaceRhino the owner and the creator of phenomenon project Engaland. We started our career as software engineers, game and back-end developers. Following you can read more about Engaland.


Engaland, the biggest planet in the Engaverse, uncharted and unexplored, is a world of unknowns and mysteries. For years, the five realms of the Engaverse attempted to explore and colonize the planet, but were unable to do so, until now. The recent invention of Opifex Machines and the development of specialized droids, known as Endros, has allowed the five realms to set foot on the planet without risking lives of their citizens.
